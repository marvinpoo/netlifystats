# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The NetlifyStats team takes security issues seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

If you believe you've found a security vulnerability in NetlifyStats, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly** or to any third parties.

2. **Email us** at `coppnic.@e.email` with details about the vulnerability.
   - Please include a description of the issue and steps to reproduce it
   - If possible, include any proof-of-concept code or screenshots
   - Let us know how you would like to be acknowledged

3. **Allow time for response and resolution**. We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours and will strive to keep you informed about our progress in resolving the issue.

### What to Expect

- Initial response within 48 hours acknowledging receipt of your vulnerability report
- Regular updates on the progress of resolving the vulnerability
- Notification when the vulnerability has been fixed
- Credit for the discovery (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

### Scope

This security policy applies to the latest version of NetlifyStats available in our main repository.

### Responsible Disclosure Guidelines

We kindly ask that you:

- Provide us reasonable time to investigate and address the security issue before disclosing it to others
- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, data destruction, or service interruption during your research
- Do not access or modify data that does not belong to you
- Do not conduct denial-of-service tests

### Security Best Practices for Users

1. **API Tokens**: Store your Netlify API tokens securely and never share them publicly.

2. **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables (`.env.local`) to store sensitive information rather than hardcoding them.

3. **Regular Updates**: Keep your installation of NetlifyStats updated with the latest security patches.

4. **Access Control**: Limit access to your dashboard to authorized personnel only.

### Thank You

We value the work of security researchers in improving the security of our project. We are committed to working with you to understand and resolve security issues responsibly.
